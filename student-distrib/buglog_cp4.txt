Cat was hitting a page fault after reading from a file
- Solution: we weren't checking if file offset went beyond the file (inode->size), so we now return 0 for end of file 

Vidmap page table wasn't being accessed
- Solution: we were using a 4MB page for the page directory entry on accident, which completely bypassed the page table.

Vidmap test wouldn't pass
- Solution: test runs in kernel mode, so we comment out the user mode pointer check

ls wasn't printing newlines
- Solution: terminal write should write all nbytes, ignoring null terminators

Closing the terminal fails but marks it as closed
- Solution: check the result of the closing before flagging the file descriptor as unused

Read/write/close on unused file descriptors were possible
- Solution: check the used flag for the target file descriptor
