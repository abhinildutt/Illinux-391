1. Running ping pong on one terminal, wrote to all other terminals even after switching.
Solution: Video mapping was not updated correctly when switching

2. Can not call execute 3 times in kernel becuase it would never return
Soltuion: initialize other terminals on switch

3. Program was page faulting on switching
Soltuion: In paging.c  it was index instead of addr and we were adding the wrong offset

4. Cursor was not working between terminals
Soltuion: Setting the executing terminal's cursor values when switching

5. Running programs occasionally page faults
Soltuion:  Setting interrupts properly 

 6. Typing after the counter starts it never reaches the keyboard handler
 Solution: Had to change to trap vs interrupt gate

 7. Switching too quickly between screens breaks
 Soltuion:  The currently running process that was in the background is now in the foreground so curr_pcb->terminal_id == curr_displaying_terminal_id becomes true and we must map it directly to the screen

 8. RTC frequency could not be different for multiple programs:
 Soltuion: Virtualize the RTC
